# SOT Framework

This repository contains the SOT (SOPs, Orchestration, Tools) Framework, a structured approach to building reliable agentic workflows.

## Overview

The SOT Framework is designed to separate decision-making (AI agents) from deterministic execution (tools/scripts). It consists of three main layers:

*   **SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures):** Detailed instructions on *what* to do.
*   **Orchestration:** AI agents that intelligently route tasks based on SOPs.
*   **Tools:** Deterministic scripts that perform the actual work.

## Directory Structure

*   `AGENTS.md`: Framework overview and global principles.
*   `00-SOPs/`: Standard Operating Procedures.
*   `00-TOOLS/`: Deterministic tools and scripts.
*   `00-KBs/`: Knowledge Base documents.

## Getting Started

Refer to `AGENTS.md` for a comprehensive guide on how to use and contribute to the SOT Framework.
